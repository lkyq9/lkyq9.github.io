    <h1> Boxer </h1>
 <p>
  Boxers were originally breed in Germany as hunting dogs for deer and wild boar, but today they are loyal companions. Boxers are the goof balls of the canine world and they are proud of it. Boxers are always ready to play and see jumping on their owners as on okay thing to do. Boxers can be trained but the owner must be aware of the “goof ball” temperament to get through to them.
